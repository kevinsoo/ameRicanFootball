This is a project (written in `R`) for scraping, visualizing, and analyzing NFL data. The data used here comes from the [Pro Football Reference](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/). I don't know much about American Football (I prefer [soccer](https://github.com/kevinsoo/socceRstuff)), so I'm getting help from [Evelyn Yarzebinski](https://github.com/evementen) to ask and answer questions of interest.

## Deflate/Inflate-gate
`scrapeQB.R` is the script used to scrape QB data, which is then saved as a data frame; `QBStats.Rda`. To include data from QBs I didn't include, you can add the appropriate names and links (to the player career Gamelogs page). Provided the source is updated, running the script at any given time should give you up-to-date statistics.
